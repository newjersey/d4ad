Practical Nursing meets the student''s need for vocational training and the needs of the community for qualified LPNs in the workforce.  Nursing is a helping profession that assists individuals, families, groups and communities in the promotion of optimal health.  The aim of nursing is to promote wellness and assist in preventing illness, restoring health and facilitating coping.  Nursing is a dynamic interpersonal profession in which goals are best accomplished through use of the nursing process.  Nursing care is provided to patients whose self-care deficits require assistance from the nurse in meeting health care needs.

Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) function as a contributing member of the health care team by providing nursing care under the supervision or direction of a registered nurse or licensed physician.  The LPN''s scope of practice includes contributing to data collection, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation of the plan of care.  Duties may include assignment of specific tasks and teaching basic nursing skills and principles.  Practical nurses provide safe and effective care for individuals or groups in various settings.

Practical Nursing meets the student''s need for vocational training and the needs of the community for qualified LPNs in the workforce.  Nursing is a helping profession that assists individuals, families, groups and communities in the promotion of optimal health.  The aim of nursing is to promote wellness and assist in preventing illness, restoring health and facilitating coping.  Nursing is a dynamic interpersonal profession in which goals are best accomplished through use of the nursing process.  Nursing care is provided to patients whose self-care deficits require assistance from the nurse in meeting health care needs.

Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) function as a contributing member of the health care team by providing nursing care under the supervision or direction of a registered nurse or licensed physician.  The LPN''s scope of practice includes contributing to data collection, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation of the plan of care.  Duties may include assignment of specific tasks and teaching basic nursing skills and principles.  Practical nurses provide safe and effective care for individuals or groups in various settings.

This online program provides you with the knowledge, skills, and applied practice opportunities to become a professional Mediator and Certified Arbitrator. These skills can be used to advance you in your current career or to help you jumpstart a career as a professional Mediator and Arbitrator.
The program includes skill building opportunities in areas such as communication, negotiation, and facilitation, all using the InAccord® Conflict Analysis model for mediation and arbitration practice. You will learn the three phases that are used in the InAccord® model: pre-interview, mediation procedure, and post interview. Then, you will apply this knowledge to simulated role plays, focused on workplace and commercial disputes. You will learn a similar model for the InAccord® Arbitration training. Arbitration differs from mediation in that an arbitrator actually renders decisions in disputes whereas a mediator facilitates a collaborative solution designed by the parties in dispute. As part of the arbitration training, you will learn how to facilitate a hearing, weigh evidence and testimony, and render an award.
This interactive online training program includes tutorials, quizzes, and self-assessments to help deepen your understanding of mediation and arbitration using the InAccord® Conflict Analysis model.

CORE is a foundation course in hair cutting, color, texture, styling, skin and nails, and an introduction to our Paul Mitchell Schools culture. Future Professionals learn cosmetology fundamentals in theory, and then practice them hands-on in the safe environment of the classroom. You''ll work on mannequin heads and receive close, personal attention from a Learning Leader who will guide you every step of the way.

You''ll work on mannequin heads and receive close, personal attention from a Learning Leader who will guide you every step of the way.

LEVEL 2 ADAPTIVE
During the ADAPTIVE phase, the learning continues in the classroom and on the clinic floor classroom, where Future Professionals practice and perfect the fundamental skills learned in Core. Adaptive-level students work on live models in a salon-like environment with the oversight and support of their Learning Leaders. You will work with professional products and learn how to conduct client consultations and create extraordinary guest-service experiences.

LEVEL 3 CREATIVE
Future Professionals expand their skills and are introduced to more advanced and creative techniques during the CREATIVE phase. At the Creative level, students prepare to become salon-ready by working more independently at a pace and in conditions that are similar to those in a salon. You will also develop your speed, build a resume and portfolio, and prepare to pass the cosmetology state board exam.

PHASE TWO
PHASE TWO clinic classroom is an optional course of intensive study within the Cosmetology program for those Future Professionals who want to be challenged to their highest level of performance.
