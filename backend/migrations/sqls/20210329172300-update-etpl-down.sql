This online program provides you with the knowledge, skills, and applied practice opportunities to become a professional Mediator and Certified Arbitrator. These skills can be used to advance you in your current career or to help you jumpstart a career as a professional Mediator and Arbitrator.
The program includes skill building opportunities in areas such as communication, negotiation, and facilitation, all using the InAccord® Conflict Analysis model for mediation and arbitration practice. You will learn the three phases that are used in the InAccord® model: pre-interview, mediation procedure, and post interview. Then, you will apply this knowledge to simulated role plays, focused on workplace and commercial disputes. You will learn a similar model for the InAccord® Arbitration training. Arbitration differs from mediation in that an arbitrator actually renders decisions in disputes whereas a mediator facilitates a collaborative solution designed by the parties in dispute. As part of the arbitration training, you will learn how to facilitate a hearing, weigh evidence and testimony, and render an award.
This interactive online training program includes tutorials, quizzes, and self-assessments to help deepen your understanding of mediation and arbitration using the InAccord® Conflict Analysis model. The program also provides web based and teleconferenced role play opportunities where you can practice your skills with other students, in addition to a mentor to guide you and answer any questions you may have."','0','200','6','For complete course outline and computer requirements please see our website at http://ccpd.rutgers.edu',null,'2/1/2021 program modification - SAZ','2014-05-30 15:03:00','1','CCPD','8489324708',null,'44335','Approved','Rutgers Center for Continuing Professional Development','22600108612','Rutgers Lifelong Learning Center','3 Rutgers Plaza','New Brunswick','NJ','8901','Middlesex','Rutgers Lifelong Learning Center','3 Rutgers Plaza','New Brunswick','NJ','8901','CCPD','CCPD','CCPD Enrollment Services','8489324708',null,'7329327164','http://ccpd.rutgers.edu','ccpd@docs.rutgers.edu','16','12',null,'2026-07-01 00:00:00','2','1','1','1','"Korean, Spanish"','1','1','2','1','2','2','2','1','"George St. New Brunswick, NJ"',null,'New Brunswick Train Station',null,null,'"5/28/2022 - ETPL renewal expiration - SAZ

petabyte-scale data warehouse in Amazon Web Services (AWS). This AWS Data Warehousing course demonstrates how to collect, store, and prepare data for the data warehouse by
using other AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EMR, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, and Amazon S3. Additionally, this course demonstrates how to use business
intelligence tools to perform analysis on your data·.
2) This Big Data on AWS course introduces you to cloud-based big data solutions such as Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Kinesis and the rest of the Amazon Web Services
(AWS) big data platform. In this course, we show you how to use Amazon EMR to process data using the broad ecosystem of Hadoop tools like Hive and Hue. We also teach you how
to create big data environments, work with Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Quicksight, Amazon Athena and Amazon Kinesis, and leverage best practices to design big
data environments for security and cost-effectiveness."','0','320','6',null,null,'"9/18/2020 updated per Section J - SAZ
